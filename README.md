# spill

a simple, open-source mac app for freewriting.

this is spill - your mental drain unclogger. write continuously, think clearly, breakthrough the noise.

## what it does

spill helps you freewrite - that's writing continuously for a set time without stopping, editing, or caring about grammar. pure stream of consciousness to help you think through anything that's stuck in your head.

- 15-minute timer (customizable)
- no backspaces, no spell-check, no distractions
- ai reflection with chatgpt/claude integration
- local file storage with history
- clean, minimal interface
- dictation support
- dark/light theme

## how to use

1. think of something bouncing around your head
2. start the timer
3. write. don't stop. don't edit.

freewriting helps you:
- work through decisions
- process emotions
- generate ideas
- find clarity on complex problems
- break through creative blocks
