# Welcome to Freewrite :)

**Please, I'm begging you — read this guide. It's 5 minutes max.**

My name is Faraaz.

I built this app after a complete breakdown.

Not the crying-on-the-floor kind (though there was some of that). The creative kind. The kind where you stare at a blank document for hours, feeling like your brain has turned to mush.

This was three years ago. I was stuck on everything — work decisions, personal relationships, even what to have for lunch. My thoughts felt like tangled headphones that had been sitting in a drawer for months.

Then I met this older writer at a coffee shop. She was probably in her 70s, hunched over a notebook, writing furiously by hand. When she got up to leave, I noticed she'd filled maybe 10 pages in the hour I'd been there.

I asked her about it. She laughed and said, "Kid, this isn't writing. This is thinking out loud on paper."

She told me about freewriting — a technique from 1973 where you write continuously for a set time without stopping, editing, or caring about grammar. Pure stream of consciousness.

"Your brain is like a clogged drain," she said. "Sometimes you need to let all the gunk flow out before the clear water comes through."

**This is not a journaling app or a note-taking app.**
If you use it for that, you'll open it twice and forget it exists.

This is a tool purely for freewriting — for unclogging your mental drain.

I've used it to work through shutting down my startup, figuring out whether to move across the country, and processing the weirdest family drama you can imagine. It's led to breakthroughs I never saw coming.

## How it works (stupidly simple):

1. Think of something that's been bouncing around your head
2. Click fullscreen  
3. Start the timer
4. Write. No backspaces. Don't stop.

When the timer ends, it fades back in. You're done.

## The rules (non-negotiable):

- **No backspaces** — resist the urge
- **No spell-checking** — it doesn't matter
- **Brief 5-10 second pauses are fine**, but keep your fingers moving
- **Let your mind wander** — you might start writing about work stress and end up processing your relationship with your dad
- **No judgment** — your brain knows what it's doing

Think of it like this: your mind is a GPT model, and you're just exhausting all the tokens around a specific topic. By the end, you'll usually have clarity you didn't expect.

## If you're new to this:

I know 15 minutes sounds terrifying. "What do I even write about?"

Try this tomorrow morning before work. Open the app and spend 15 minutes on: **"What am I working on today? Why is that the most important thing for me to focus on?"**

Don't stop writing for 15 minutes.

This simple practice completely changed how I approach my days. I used to get lost in busy work and email rabbit holes. Now I usually finish this session 100x clearer about what actually matters — and often completely change my original plan for the better.

Do it for 3 days straight. See what happens.

## Other prompts I use:

- "Something happened today that really threw me off. I'm feeling X about it, and I think..."
- "I have this half-baked idea that won't leave me alone. Basically..."  
- "I'm falling for someone and need to think through this mess of feelings..."
- "I think I need to make some big changes. Here's what I'm considering..."

**The starting prompt is everything.** Spend time choosing it.

Some people are better at processing emotions through writing. Others work through ideas and problems. Try both. Find your groove.

## Why this matters:

Freewriting became the most valuable skill I developed in my twenties.

It helped me decide to leave my corporate job. It helped me process my parents' divorce. It made me a better partner (turns out, writing letters is incredibly powerful). It's how I work through startup ideas now.

On my worst days, I write it all out and feel human again.

## The app itself:

I know it looks like nothing — black text, white background, timer. That's intentional.

No spell-check. No markdown. No distractions. Just you and your thoughts.

## Bonus features:

**1. AI Reflection:** After a session, click "Chat." It'll send your writing to ChatGPT or Claude with a custom prompt I've refined over months. AI is surprisingly good at spotting patterns you missed.

**2. Timer Options:** Scroll on the timer with your trackpad to change duration. Start with 5-10 minutes if 15 feels like too much. I do 25-minute sessions when brainstorming big projects.

**3. Font Vibes:** I'm weird about this, but font choice affects my thinking. Emotional stuff gets big Arial. Business ideas get clean serif. Use the random button to find your vibe.

**4. Local History:** Click the clock (bottom right) to see past sessions. Everything stays on your device. Click the file path to open in Finder.

That 70-year-old writer was right. Sometimes you need to let the gunk flow out first.

Try it. See what comes through.
